# Submission Reminder App

A simple Bash-based tool designed to help instructors keep track of student assignment submissions. This script scans a list of student assignments and sends reminders for those who have not submitted yet.

---

## Features

- Automatically reads a CSV-style file containing student submission statuses.
- Sends reminders for assignments not yet submitted.
- Configurable assignment name and days remaining via environment file.
- Modular design separating configuration, functions, and main script.
- Easy to set up and run with minimal dependencies (only Bash).

## Project Structure

```

submission\_reminder\_\<your\_name>/
├── app/
│   └── reminder.sh          # Main script to trigger reminders
├── assets/
│   └── submissions.txt     # List of students and their submission statuses
├── config/
│   └── config.env          # Configuration file with assignment details
├── modules/
│   └── functions.sh        # Helper functions used by the main script

## Setup Instructions

1. Run the environment setup script:

    ```bash
    bash create_environment.sh
    ```

2. Enter your name when prompted. This creates a project folder named `submission_reminder_<your_name>` with all necessary files.

3. Navigate into the project folder:

    ```bash
    cd submission_reminder_<your_name>
    ```

4. Run the reminder app:

    ```bash
    ./startup.sh
    ```

---

## Configuration

- Modify the assignment and days remaining by editing:

    ```
    config/config.env
    ```

- Update student submission statuses in:

    ```
    assets/submissions.txt
    ```

---

## How It Works

- The `reminder.sh` script loads the assignment config and helper functions.
- It reads through the `submissions.txt` file.
- For each student who has not submitted the assignment matching the configured assignment name, it prints a reminder.

---

## Requirements

- Bash shell (Linux, macOS, or WSL on Windows).
